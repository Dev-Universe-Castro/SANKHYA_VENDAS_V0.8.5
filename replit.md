## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
The following variables are configured in `.env.local`:

- `SANKHYA_TOKEN` - Authentication token for Sankhya API
- `SANKHYA_APPKEY` - Application key for Sankhya integration
- `SANKHYA_USERNAME` - Sankhya username
- `SANKHYA_PASSWORD` - Sankhya password
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (optional) - Public URL for the application

**Note**: For production deployment, these should be moved to Replit Secrets for better security.

## Development

### Running the Application
The application runs automatically via the configured workflow:
- Command: `npm run dev`
- Port: 5000
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (required for Replit)

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 5000
- `npm run build` - Build production bundle
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### API Routes
All API routes use dynamic rendering (not statically generated) because they interact with the Sankhya ERP system in real-time.

## Deployment

### Production Deployment
To deploy this application to production on Replit:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Replit Secrets
2. Configure deployment settings using the deployment tool
3. Use `npm run build` to create production bundle
4. Use `npm run start` to serve the production build

### Performance Considerations
- API routes use `request.url` for query parameters (dynamic routes)
- Images should use Next.js Image component with priority for LCP
- Consider implementing caching strategies for Sankhya API responses

## User Preferences
None recorded yet.

## Known Issues
- Some API routes show warnings during build about dynamic server usage (expected behavior)
- Minor hydration warnings in development mode (non-critical)
- Browser console shows autocomplete and image optimization suggestions (optional improvements)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Move environment variables from `.env.local` to Replit Secrets for production
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries for better error handling
- [ ] Add loading states for better UX
- [ ] Optimize images with Next.js Image priority attribute
- [ ] Consider adding API response caching to reduce Sankhya API calls
